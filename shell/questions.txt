1. Non Recursive Shell script that accepts any number of arguments and prints them in reverse order.
    ( Eg. prog A B C should produce C BA as output)

2. Shell script that accepts two file names as arguments, checks if the permission for these files are identical and
  if the permissions are identical output the common permissions otherwise output each file name followed by its permission.

3. Shell function that takes a valid directory name as an argument and recursively descends all the subdirectories
  finds the maximum length of any file in that hierarchy and writes this maximum value to the standard output.

4. Shell script that accepts valid login names as arguments and prints their corresponding home directories
  if no arguments are specified, print a suitable error message.

The parent process waits for its child to finish ( by executing wait() )
and prints its own process id and the id of its child process and then exits
